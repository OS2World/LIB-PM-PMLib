/**
 * Prohibit copy construction and copy assignment.
 *
 * Class noncopyable is a base class. Derive your own class from
 * noncopyable when you want to prohibit copy construction and
 * copy assignment.
 * 
 * Some objects, particularly those which hold complex resources like
 * files or network connections, have no sensible copy semantics.
 * Sometimes there are possible copy semantics, but these would be
 * of very limited usefulness and be very difficult to implement
 * correctly.  Sometimes you're implementing a class that doesn't
 * need to be copied just yet and you don't want to take the time
 * to write the appropriate functions. Deriving from noncopyable
 * will prevent the otherwise implicitly-generated functions
 * (which don't have the proper semantics) from becoming a
 * trap for other programmers.
 * 
 * The traditional way to deal with these is to declare a private
 * copy constructor and copy assignment, and then document why this
 * is done. But deriving from noncopyable is simpler and
 * clearer, and doesn't require additional documentation.
