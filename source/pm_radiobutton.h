 * Radio button control window class.

 * The PMRadioButton class creates and manages radio button control
 * windows. A radio button is a circle or a diamond with associated
 * text representing a choice. When a user selects the choice, the radio
 * button is filled to indicate that the choice is selected. The
 * user can clear the radio button by selecting another radio button.
 * Radio buttons are mutually exclusive.
 *
 * You can construct and destruct objects of this class.

     * <dt><i>BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON</i><dd>Creates an auto-radio button (see also

     *                                  auto-radio button, the system
     *                                  automatically selects the button and

     *                                  auto-radio buttons in the group.
     * <dt><i>BS_AUTOSIZE       </i><dd>Creates a button that is sized
     *                                  automatically to ensure that the contents
     *                                  fit.  Note:  The cx or cy parameter of
     *                                  must be specified as -1 to implement the
     *                                  autosize feature.
     * <dt><i>BS_NOCURSORSELECT </i><dd>Creates an auto-radio button that will
     *                                  not be selected automatically when the
     *                                  user moves the cursor to the button using
     *                                  the cursor-movement keys. This style is
     *                                  valid only in combination with the
     *                                  BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON style or the
     *                                  AUTORADIOBUTTON statement in a
     *                                  resource-definition file.
     * <dt><i>BS_RADIOBUTTON    </i><dd>Creates a radio button-a small circle
     *                                  that has text displayed to its right.
     *                                  Radio buttons usually are used in groups
     *                                  of related, but exclusive, choices. When
     *                                  the user selects a radio button, the
     *                                  button sends a WM_CONTROL message to its
     *                                  owner window. The user should select the
     *                                  button and remove the selection from the
     *                                  other radio buttons in the group.
