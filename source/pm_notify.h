/**
 * Notify another thread.
 *
 * An application can use an notify object to trigger execution of
 * other threads. This is useful if, for example, one thread
 * provides data to many other threads. Using an notify object frees
 * the other threads from the trouble of polling to determine when
 * new data is available.
 *
 * None of the functions in this class throws exceptions because
 * an exception probably has been thrown already or is about
 * to be thrown.
 *
 * You can construct and destruct objects of this class.
